                    The main one is in December, before Christmas Eve. Students from the senior classes prepare with their teachers or with the music band, also located at school, the song they will be performing for the whole school!

                <p>
                    And the second one takes place in the end of July, during the ceremony of graduation of the senior classes. All songs are sung by the students from the music band in order to show, what they achieved during their stay at school!
